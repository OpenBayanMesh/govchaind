# govchain Network Configuration

## Tokenless Architecture

govchain operates as a **tokenless blockchain** designed for public good:

### Key Principles
- **No Economic Barriers**: Volunteers can participate without purchasing tokens
- **Data-Driven Governance**: Decisions based on data quality and community consensus
- **Public Service Mission**: Focus on transparency and government accountability

### Volunteer Node Operators

#### How to Join
1. **Build the blockchain**: `ignite chain build`
2. **Join as volunteer**: `./join-as-volunteer.sh <node-name> <genesis-url>`
3. **Start your node**: `./build/govchaind start`

#### Requirements
- Reliable internet connection
- Basic server hardware (2+ cores, 4GB+ RAM)
- Commitment to network uptime
- Storage for blockchain data

#### Responsibilities
- Validate transactions
- Participate in consensus
- Maintain node uptime
- Support data integrity

### Future Tokenomics

Tokenomics will be introduced later based on:
- Network growth and stability
- Community governance decisions
- Sustainable incentive mechanisms
- Regulatory compliance

### Data Submission

Government datasets can be submitted without tokens:
- Upload to IPFS
- Submit metadata to blockchain as entries
- Community validates quality
- No fees for public data

### Governance Model

Decisions made through:
- **Volunteer Consensus**: Node operators vote
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Contribution-based weight
- **Public Input**: Community proposals
- **Transparency**: All decisions on-chain
